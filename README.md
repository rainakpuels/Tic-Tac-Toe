# About

This is an exercise developed during MIT xPro Full Stack Professional Certificate in Coding.

Using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS I created a React Tic Tac Toe board.

# Roadmap of Future Improvemenets
Usually, when Tic Tac Toe is played on paper, the winner strikes through their three in a row. It would be great to have this as part of the virtal game.

It would also be fun to replace the Xs and Os with emojis or other fun symbols.
